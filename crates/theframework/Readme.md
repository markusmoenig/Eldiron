# TheFramework

TheFramework is the UI and application framework for [Eldiron](https://github.com/markusmoenig/Eldiron).

It provides an abstraction layer for applications and games. You create your app inside a trait, pass it to TheFramework, and it runs on all supported backends.

Without any enabled options, TheFramework opens a window and provides a pixel buffer for drawing and user events (mouse, keyboard, trackpads etc.) to your application trait.

## Option: ui

With the **ui** option TheFramework becomes a full-featured UI framework for professional desktop and web apps.
