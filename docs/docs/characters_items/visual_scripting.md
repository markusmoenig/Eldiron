![Characters and Items](/img/docs/characters_items.png)

The **visual script** editor allows you to create **Eldrin** scripts without having to type code directly. It works by dragging and dropping **commands** from the left toolbar into the editor.

The editor has one folder for every **event** you support for this entity.

## Events

Dragging and dropping the **Event** item creates a new event, re-name it to the [event](events) you want to support.

As your player character probably supports several **intent** types, you can name an event to support one specific intent type, for example, naming an event **"intent: use"** would create an event folder which just handles use intents.
