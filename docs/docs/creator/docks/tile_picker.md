![Tile Picker](/img/screenshots/dungeon3d_iso.png)

The tile picker dock is open when working on maps, like regional maps or screens. The currently selected tile is used for example for the [Apply Tile](/docs/creator/actions/#apply-tile) sector based action and the [Rect](/docs/creator/tools/rect) tool.

The [Edit / Maximize](/docs/creator/actions/#edit--maximize) action opens the integrated tile editor where you can directly edit the tile.
 
Changes to the tile are instantly reflected on the map. Undo / redo are tile based. Each tile has its own undo stack.
