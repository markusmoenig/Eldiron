The **Vertex Tool** (keyboard shortcut **'V'**) allows you to **select, edit, and delete vertices** in the map.

Unlike the **Selection Tool**, which can select multiple types of geometry at once, the **Vertex Tool** is specifically designed for working with **vertices only**.

## Selection Modes

- **Click**: Select a vertex.
- **Shift + Click** (on empty area): Create a new vertex.
- **Shift + Click**: Select multiple vertices.
- **Alt (Mac: Option) + Click**: Remove vertices from the selection.
- **Click + Drag**: Move selected vertices.
- **Click + Drag (Empty Area)**: Select a rectangular area of vertices.
- **Delete Key**: Remove selected vertices.
- **Escape Key**: Clear the selection.
