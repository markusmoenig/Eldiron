The **Selection Tool** (keyboard shortcut **'S'**) allows you to **quickly select, edit, and delete geometry** in the map.

Unlike the **Vertex, Linedef, and Sector Tools**, which only allow selecting one type of geometry at a time, the **Selection Tool** lets you select **vertices, linedefs, and sectors** simultaneously.

## Selection Modes

- **Click**: Select geometry.
- **Shift + Click**: Select multiple items.
- **Alt (Mac: Option) + Click**: Remove items from the selection.
- **Click + Drag**: Move the selection.
- **Click + Drag (Empty Area)**: Select a rectangular area of geometry.
- **Delete Key**: Remove selected geometry.
- **Escape Key**: Clear the selection.
