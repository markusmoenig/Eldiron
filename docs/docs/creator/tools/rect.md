The **Rect Tool** (keyboard shortcut **'R'**) allows you to **directly draw tiles** onto the map.

Unlike other map-based tools, the **Rect Tool does not edit geometry**—instead, it **instantly places selected the selected tile* into the map grid by creating a rectangular sector.

### How It Works

- The **Rect Tool automatically creates the geometry** for a **sector** and **assigns the selected tile**.
- Click on the map to **draw**.
- **Shift + Click** to **delete content**.

## When to Use the Rect Tool

- **2D Camera**: The **Rect Tool is the primary tool** for drawing tiles.

- **3D Camera**: Draw tiles directly on 3D surfaces and terrain.

The **Rect Tool** is a fast and intuitive way to add **tiles, decorations, and details** to your maps.
