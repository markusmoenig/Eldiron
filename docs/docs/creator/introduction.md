**Eldiron Creator** is where everything comes together—a **graphical editor** that lets you build your own adventures.

On the **left side** of the screen, you’ll find a **list of tools**. These tools are used to **edit the geometry** of the currently selected region or content. The 2D and 3D geometry is displayed in the **geometry editor** in the middle of the screen.

To the right of the screen you see the **project tree** which lists all editable items of your project, like **regions**, **characters** and more. Below the **project tree** are the settings of the currently selected **action** and beneath that the minimap of the current content. The minimap automatically adjusts to the current context (regions, tiles).

At the bottom of the screen you see the currently active **dock**, in this screenshot the tile picker. To the right of the **dock** area is the **action list**, it lists all [actions](actions/) which can be performed at the current moment (depending on the selected geometry, item and camera).
