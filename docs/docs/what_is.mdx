## Packet

Values in **Eldrin Script** are represented by a built-in data container called a **Packet**.
A packet holds three numeric fields and an optional string and is used for all commands, events, and attributes.

See the [Eldrin Script](/docs/characters_items/eldrin_scripting_language/#values) documentation.

## Tile Id

A tile id is a unique identifier string for a given tile in the [Tile Picker](#tile-picker). Characters and items use tile ids in their attribute *TOML* files, or in scripts, to reference a specific tile. When a tile is selected in the tile picker, use the [Copy Tile ID](/docs/creator/actions/#copy-tile-id) action to copy the id to the clipboard (and paste it where you need it).

## Tile Picker

The tile picker is displayed in the dock area when the current editing context is map related. You can select a tile and apply various acttions, [maximizing](/docs/creator/actions/#edit--maximize) the dock opens the integrated tile editor.
