# Example Games Created with Eldiron

As Eldiron continues to mature, we are excited to share the first example games developed using it.

## Hideout

This is a 2D, top-down example game. You have returned from many adventures only to discover that an Orc in your garden has stolen the key to your treasury. Your mission is to retrieve the key and reclaim what is rightfully yours. The game also showcases a simple merchant system and item interactions (ignite the torch!), as well as portal travel to an (empty) dungeon.

<Admonition type="warning" title="WebGPU Required">
    Since the 29th of November the Hideout example uses the new GPU based renderer. A WebGPU enabled browser is now required (all modern browsers work).
