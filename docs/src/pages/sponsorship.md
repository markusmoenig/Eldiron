## Eldiron – A Retro RPG Creation Platform

Hello,

I’m Markus Moenig, the creator of **Eldiron**, an open-source, cross-platform game creation platform focused on **classic retro RPGs**.

Eldiron enables creators to build games inspired by timeless RPGs such as *Ultima*, *Baldur’s Gate*, and *Ultima Underworld* — combining the **aesthetic and gameplay depth of classic RPGs** with **modern tooling, performance, and extensibility**.

The goal is simple:  
**Make deep, nostalgic RPG creation accessible again, without sacrificing technical power.**

### What Makes Eldiron Unique

- **Classic RPG Focus**  
  Built specifically for retro RPG experiences, supporting **top-down, isometric, and first-person perspectives** within a single unified toolset.

- **Open Worlds and Dungeons**  
  Designed for both **expansive open-world adventures** and **immersive dungeon-crawling experiences**, allowing creators to mix and match styles freely.

- **Modern Engine, Classic Feel**  
  A Rust-based engine with a strong focus on pixel art, procedural content, and deterministic rendering — optimized for retro aesthetics and performance.

- **Visual + Scripted Creation**  
  Worlds can be built visually, while deeper gameplay logic can be added through scripting and procedural systems.

- **Cross-Platform by Design**  
  Desktop-first, with an architecture prepared for future web and multi-platform distribution.

- **Open Source Core**  
  Transparent development, community-driven evolution, and long-term sustainability.

- **Growing Community**  
  A steadily growing group of creators and retro RPG enthusiasts actively following development and preparing projects for the upcoming v1 release.

### Release Scope and Long-Term Vision

**Version 1** of Eldiron is focused on delivering a polished and accessible platform for **single-player RPG creation**, ensuring stability, usability, and strong documentation for creators.

Internally, the engine and architecture are already designed with **multiplayer and MMO-style scalability in mind**.  
Due to testing, infrastructure, and community readiness considerations, these capabilities are planned for **Version 2**, allowing v1 to remain focused and reliable while laying the groundwork for future large-scale online worlds.

This approach ensures:

- a stable and shippable v1  
- architectural continuity  
- a clear upgrade path for ambitious creators  

---

### Why This Matters

Retro RPGs remain one of the most beloved and commercially resilient genres in gaming.  
They thrive because they:

- scale well for small teams and solo developers  
- emphasize storytelling and world-building  
- evoke strong emotional nostalgia  
- remain approachable for new creators  

Despite this popularity, **very few modern tools are dedicated specifically to classic RPG creation**.  
Eldiron aims to fill that gap and become a **go-to platform for retro RPG development**, while also providing a long-term path toward larger online worlds.

### Current Status

- Actively developed with frequent updates  
- Core editor, engine, and rendering systems in place  
- Strong technical foundation with clear scalability planning  
- Roadmap focused on stabilizing and polishing a v1 release  
- Community interest growing ahead of v1  

---

### What Support Enables

Sponsorship, partnership, or grant support would directly accelerate:

- v1 stabilization and documentation  
- creator onboarding and tutorials  
- export pipelines and tooling polish  
- community infrastructure and learning resources  
- sustainable long-term development toward v2 scalability  

---

### What Partners Gain

- Visibility within a growing retro RPG and indie creator community  
- Alignment with a creator-first, open-source platform  
- Association with a technically ambitious, genre-focused tool  
- Opportunity to support and help shape an emerging RPG ecosystem  

Eldiron is not just an engine — it is the foundation for a **modern revival of classic RPG creation**, with a clear and realistic growth path toward larger shared worlds.

I would be happy to briefly demonstrate the platform and explore whether there is meaningful alignment.
