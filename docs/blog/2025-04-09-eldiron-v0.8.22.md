Eldiron v0.8.22 is now available with several exciting new features and improvements.

### 🆕 What's New

- **Screens & Widgets** – Build your game's UI with buttons, text fields, message boxes, and more.
- **New 2D Example: Hideout 2D** – Explore a new demo where you help Moody the goblin re-unite with the treasures in his lair.

I’ve created a new video walking through the new features and the Hideout 2D example. In it, I explain the mechanics behind characters, items, and the new UI system:
