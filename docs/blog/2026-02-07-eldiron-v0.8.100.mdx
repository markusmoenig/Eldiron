![Eldiron v0.8.100](/img/Eldironv0.8.100.png)

Eldiron v0.8.100 introduces many new features and bug fixes.

The main new changes are the foundation of a new terrain system, and the replacement of **Python** with the new, custom **Eldrin** scripting language.

But this release also includes dozens of smaller features. I tried to make **Eldiron Creator** easier to use and fixed many bugs as well.

The documentation on this website has been nearly completely rewritten and should now reflect the current state of **Eldiron**.

Hope you enjoy the update!

## New Features

### Creator

#### New Terrain System

  - Region settings turn terrain on / off and set a default tile_id.
  - Vertices control height and terrain smoothness and can be associated with a billboard tile (of configurable size).
  - Sectors can either exclude (cut out) terrain (for houses etc) or create ridges of varying height, width and steepness.
  - Rect tool now paints on terrain.

- "Edit Sector" action can now apply tags to sectors.
- Geometry can now be made visible / invisible without rebuilding the BVH. This lays the foundation to be able to hide roofs and other geometry in-game on the fly.
- 'Shift' + Click in the vertex tool now adds vertices in both 2D and 3D.
- Rectangle selection mode now works with all 3D cameras (previously only worked in 2D).
- New 3D Gizmo for moving vertices / linedefs and sectors along the current plane in 3D camera modes (previously only worked in 2D).
- "Automatic" mode for Actions. Apply actions automatically when clicked (or a parameter changes).
- New Azimuth / Elevation settings for the Isometric camera.
- Palette now has its own entry in the project root
  - **Clear Palette** action
  - **Import Palette...** action
  - **Remap Tile** action (Remaps a tile to the current palette)
- Pressing Cmd / Ctrl during dragging of **sectors** moves all embedded sectors with the sector. Useful for moving complete houses etc (in 2D).
- Sector creation with the linedef tool: By default manual mode is used which only closes polygons based on the click history. When Cmd / Ctrl is pressed auto mode is used which tries to close polygons automatically (also allows closing of old polygons). Auto mode however fails when operating in a grid (Rect tool).
- New **Debug Log** project tree item. Shows debug output from the server when running.
- New **Entity Tool** to move and delete entity and item instances on the map.
- New **Game Input** switch to send keyboard events directly to the running game from within the editor.
- New **Apply Tile** action now has a repeat mode setting (repeat / scale).

- **Items** can now be associated to Door / Gates (i.e. profile cutouts), controlling blocking states, visibility and more. The item name can be entered in the sector settings.
- Door / Gate billboards can now be animated when visibility changes, with scrolling up /down, left / right or fading in / out.

- Switched from Python to my own scripting language: **Eldrin**. Old projects will need minor adjustments to work again.

### Renderer

Rendering improvements and fixes:

- Support for **vertex-weighted texture blending**.
- Fixed a bug where transparent billboards would prevent proper ambient occlusion / shadow tracing.

Take care,
